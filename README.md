### I assessed the influence of dietary energy and maternal attributes (i.e., mother's age and litter type) on the relationship between body mass and antler mass in white-tailed deer
* The "lifespan" analysis explores the influence of diet energy on the relationship between body mass and antler mass throughout the lifespan of a captive colony of white-tailed deer.
* The "1.5-year-old" analysis explores the influence of diet and maternal attributes on the relationship between body and antler size in a population of 1.5-year-old white-tailed deer.
* antler size and body size were log transformed in the .csv


#### Figure 1. Predicted regressions summarizing relationships between body mass and antler mass for male white-tailed deer fed either a low energy diet (L) or standard energy diet (S) in a captive population of white-tailed deer.

#### Figure 2. Predicted regression lines depicting the relationship between body mass and antler mass for male white-tailed deer aged 1.5 years fed either a low energy diet (L) or standard energy diet (S) and born to either a multiples or singleton litter in a captive population of white-tailed deer. Singletons and males fed a low energy diet had steeper scaling relationships between antler mass and body mass.

# FACTORS INFLUENCING SCALING RELATIONSHIPS OF BODY MASS AND ANTLER MASS IN WHITE-TAILED DEER (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS)
* The "lifespan" analysis explores the influence of diet on the relationship between body and antler size throughout the lifespan of a population of white-tailed deer.
* The "1.5 year old" analysis explores the influence of diet and maternal attributes (i.e., mother's age and litter type) on the relationship between body and antler size in a population of 1.5 year old white-tailed deer.
* antler size and body size were log transformed in the .csv

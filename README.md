Scaling Relationships: antler size in relation to body size
* The "lifespan" analysis explores the influence of diet on the relationship between body and antler size throughout the lifespan of a population of white-tailed deer.
* The "1.5 year old" analysis explores the influence of diet and maternal attributes (i.e., mother's age and litter type) on the relationship between body and antler size in a population of 1.5 year old white-tailed deer.
* antler size and body size were log transformed in the .csv

# Body size vs antler size through ontogeny.  Deer were fed either a low energy diet "L" or a standard energy diet "S".
